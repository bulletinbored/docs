# Architecture

## Manager System (backend classes in `lib/`)

- **PluginManager** — handles plugin discovery, enable/disable, hook registration/execution
- **ThemeManager** — handles theme discovery, activation, and CSS URL/path resolution
- **UpdateManager** — handles version tracking and update checks for core, plugins, and themes

All managers are instantiated at the top of `index.php` and are fully integrated into the routing layer and admin panel.

## Single-File MVC (index.php)

- All core logic in one file for easy upload
- SQLite by default, MySQL configurable via `config.php`
- Session-based authentication
- Simple routing via `$_GET['action']`
- SEO-friendly URLs via `.htaccess` rewrite rules

## SEO-Friendly URLs

Clean URLs are supported via `.htaccess` rewrite rules:

- `/thread/{id}-{slug}` — single thread view
- `/category/{id}-{slug}` — category view
- `/u/{username}` — user profile

Old query-string URLs (`?action=thread&id=1`) still work internally.

## Theme System

Themes work like plugins — each theme is a folder in `themes/` with a `style.css` file:

- Configure active theme in `config.php`: `'theme' => 'freshbored'`
- Create custom themes by adding folders in `themes/`
- Theme CSS is automatically loaded by `views/header.php`
- All frontend pages use the active theme
- Admin panel uses Bootstrap 5 default styles

## Plugin System

Plugins are PHP files in `plugins/` that define an `{name}_init()` function:

- `$pluginManager->addHook('event', $callback)` — register a hook
- `$pluginManager->runHook('event', ...$args)` — fire a hook
- Plugins are auto-loaded on every request

Example plugin in `plugins/hellobored/hellobored.php` demonstrates the pattern.
